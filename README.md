# CSCODEGENERATORV1.1
Sorry, potential user, my project was recently broken and solution was crashed during making a new update for CSCODEGENERATOR. So, thats why i made a decision to move my project to the other repository, called "CSCODEGENERATOR V1.1.1. I promise that this will be done in evening (today) or tomorrow. Stay tuned:)
