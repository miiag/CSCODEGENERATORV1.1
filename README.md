# CSCODEGENERATORV1.1
Sorry, potential user, my project was recently broken and solution was crashed when i made a new update for CSCODEGENERATOR. So, thats why i made a decision to move my project to the other repository, called "CSQRCODEGENERATORDECODER". I promise that this will be done in evening (today) or tomorrow. Stay tuned:)
